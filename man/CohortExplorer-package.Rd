\title{CohortExplorer: Explorer of Profiles of Patients in a Cohort}
\description{
This software tool is designed to extract data from a randomized subset of individuals within a cohort and make it available for exploration in a 'Shiny' application environment. It retrieves date-stamped, event-level records from one or more data sources that represent patient data in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model format. This tool features a user-friendly interface that enables users to efficiently explore the extracted profiles, thereby facilitating applications, such as reviewing structured profiles.
