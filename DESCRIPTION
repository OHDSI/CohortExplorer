Description: A software tool is designed to extract data from a randomized subset of 
    individuals within a cohort. It retrieves date-stamped, event-level records from 
    one or more data sources that represent patient data in the Observational Medical 
    Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model format. This tool features a user-friendly 
    interface, powered by 'Shiny', that enables users to efficiently explore the 
    extracted profiles, thereby facilitating applications, such as reviewing 
    structured profiles.
